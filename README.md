### Hi, I'm Alex 👋

I'm a QA/automation guy and aspiring web developer. I've been building websites for a long time but it's never paid the bills. Currently focused on mastering React, JavaScript, and CSS. Also, having a lot of fun with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), learning about static-site generators, and all that cool Jamstacky stuff. 

- 📫 How to reach me: alexpeterhall @ gmail
- 🛠 I’m currently working on front-end development and test automation.
- 🚀 I’m currently learning everything React. 
- 🏍 Fun fact: I play classical violin and ride fast motorcycles.
